Personal Website

1. Project is a personal website, written in Django/Python, for the purpose of experimenting with various projects.

2. Current project ideas are:
  1. Duplicating and extending functionality of "If This, Then That" ("IFTTT").
    * IFTTT lacks the capacity to track more than one trigger at a time.
    * IFTTT lacks the capacity to track "states", that is, to take no action at first but for setting a variable to track a state, and with a second trigger, taking an action as dictated by the state of the system.
  2. Developing a mobile-accessible interface for home control.
  3. File server.

3. Project is copyrighted according to the requirements of GNU General Public License, v. 3.0.

4. Version format: YYYY.MM.DD_HH:MM:SS_username, where "username" is that of the editor.

5. Please update the CHANGELOG according to the following format:

VersionNumber : Note, where "VersionNumber" is the version number described in number 4 above, and "Note" is the commit note.
